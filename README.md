This repository contains a completed Node.js demo app that's introduced in the [Start building your app](https://shopify.dev/apps/getting-started/add-functionality) tutorial.

## Using demo app

If you plan to use the demo app, then make sure that you first complete the following setup instructions:

1. Create a [partner account](https://www.shopify.com/partners).
2. Create a [development store](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/development-stores).
3. Make sure you understand [how apps fit into Shopify](https://shopify.dev/apps/getting-started#how-apps-fit-into-shopify) and the [types of apps](https://shopify.dev/apps/getting-started/app-types) you can build.
4. Install [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/apps/getting-started/create#step-1-install-shopify-cli). Shopify CLI generates starter code for building your app and automates many common development tasks, including generating API credentials for [OAuth](https://shopify.dev/apps/auth/oauth).
5. Install the latest stable version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
6. Run `npm install` to install npm packages.
7. Run `shopify node create` to create an embedded app using Node.js.
8. Start a [local development server](https://shopify.dev/apps/getting-started/create#step-3-start-a-local-development-server).
9. Install your app on your [development store](https://shopify.dev/apps/getting-started/create#step-4-install-your-app-on-your-development-store).
10. Set up your [app navigation](https://shopify.dev/apps/app-extensions/navigation-links).
